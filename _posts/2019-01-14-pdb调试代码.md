# PDB 调试代码

这里的 pdb 可不是「可插拔数据库」，而是 Python 自带的一个调试工具，有点类似于 GNU 的 gdb。

gdb 调试 C/C++ 的代码， 而 pdb（The Python Debugger） 则用来调试 Python 代码。

pdb 至少有三种使用方式去调用，每种调用方式对应着不同的场景，但是进入调试模式后的操作逻辑相似。

- [通过 -m pdb 调用](#by_mpdb)
- [通过 pdb.run() 调用](#by_run)
- [通过pdb.set_trace()](#by_set_trace)

## 进入到调试界面

<span id = "by_mpdb">
### 通过 -m pdb 调用
</span>

针对一些小型的，只有单个文件的模块（即*.py文件），可以使用

`python -m pdb my_module.py`

的方式进入到 pdb 调试模式。

```python
# file name: test.py
def sum(a, b):
    print a
    print b
    return a+b

if __name__ == "__main__":
    a = 100
    b = 200
    c = sum(a, b)
    print c
```

通过 `-m pdb` 调用会停住在「模块文件中除注释外的第一行」，在这里就是函数签名。

```shell
$ python -m pdb test.py
> /private/tmp/test.py(2)<module>()
-> def sum(a, b):
(Pdb)
```

<span id = "by_run">
### 通过 pdb.run() 调用
</span>

针对交互式终端（即终端输入 `python` 进入的界面），可以使用 `pdb.run(func_name(**args))` 就可以调试当前终端的某些函数或者类，但不常用。

```
$ python
Python 2.7.15 (default, Sep 18 2018, 20:16:18)
[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 9.1.0 (clang-902.0.39.2)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> def sum(a, b):
...     print a
...     print b
...     return a + b
...
>>> import pdb
>>> pdb.run('sum(100, 200)')
> <string>(1)<module>()->None
(Pdb) s
--Call--
> <stdin>(1)sum()
(Pdb)
```

可以通过上面代码的倒数第二行看出，通过 pdb 进入到了 「当前 python shell 的 sum() 里」，但是 pdb 的很多功能并不如预期，所以很少用这种方法。

<span id = "by_set_trace">
### 通过pdb.set_trace()
</span>

在大型项目中，通常会有很多模块文件，也有复杂的调用关系，这时再用 `-m pdb` 的方式就太低效了。这时可以使用 `pdb.set_trace()` 的方法做定位。程序会自动运行，直到运行到 set_trace() 的地方。

```python
# file name: test.py
import pdb

def sum(a, b):
    print a
    print b
    return a+b

if __name__ == "__main__":
    a = 100
    pdb.set_trace()
    b = 200
    c = sum(a, b)
    print c
```

```shell
$ python
> /private/tmp/test.py(12)<module>()
-> b = 200
(Pdb)
```

可以看到直接运行到了 `pdb.set_trace()` 的下一行。

## PDB调试指令

先来看一张表格。

命令|作用|解释
:------|:------|:------------------------
h(elp) |帮助    |如果没有参数，则打印可用命令列表。使用命令作为参数，打印有关该命令的帮助。|
n(ext) |下一行  |运行到下一行，把任何调用都视为一行（即不进入函数体）                   |
s(tep) |执行当前行，进入下一行|和 n(ext) 不同，它会执行当前行，并且有调用会进入到函数体内    |
l(ist) |查看当前文件源代码|可以查看当前文件的源代码，有箭头指向当前行                    |
a(rgs) |查看当前函数的参数|可以查看当前函数接受的参数以及其值                           |
c(ontinue) |继续执行|会执行到下一个断点处，如果没有断点，就一直运行到结束                 |
p expression |执行命令|这个参数在调试中非常有用，它可以打印变量，也可以执行语句，执行一些内建函数，例如 len(), dir(), \_\_dict__ 等等|
b(reak) |打断点|常用的打断点方式，后接行数或者函数名，会在对应行数和函数的第一行打上断点，可以 c(ontinue) 直接到断点处|
cl(ear) |清空断点|清空 b(reak) 所打的断点|
q(uit) |退出   |放弃治疗，退出调试模式                                              |

常用的在上面的表格中了，当然还有更多的用法可以参照 [26.2. pdb — The Python Debugger](https://docs.python.org/zh-cn/2.7/library/pdb.html) 。

下面会附上一些渣翻。

### h(elp) [command]

如果没有参数则打印可用命令列表。

如果有参数则打印参数对应的命令帮助。

如果参数为 `pdb` 则展示关于 pdb 完整的文档。

### w(here)
Print a stack trace, with the most recent frame at the bottom. An arrow indicates the current frame, which determines the context of most commands.

### d(own)
Move the current frame one level down in the stack trace (to a newer frame).

### u(p)
Move the current frame one level up in the stack trace (to an older frame).

### b(reak) [[filename:]lineno | function[, condition]]
With a lineno argument, set a break there in the current file. With a function argument, set a break at the first executable statement within that function. The line number may be prefixed with a filename and a colon, to specify a breakpoint in another file (probably one that hasn’t been loaded yet). The file is searched on sys.path. Note that each breakpoint is assigned a number to which all the other breakpoint commands refer.

If a second argument is present, it is an expression which must evaluate to true before the breakpoint is honored.

Without argument, list all breaks, including for each breakpoint, the number of times that breakpoint has been hit, the current ignore count, and the associated condition if any.

### tbreak [[filename:]lineno | function[, condition]]
Temporary breakpoint, which is removed automatically when it is first hit. The arguments are the same as break.

### cl(ear) [filename:lineno | bpnumber [bpnumber …]]
With a filename:lineno argument, clear all the breakpoints at this line. With a space separated list of breakpoint numbers, clear those breakpoints. Without argument, clear all breaks (but first ask confirmation).

### disable [bpnumber [bpnumber …]]
Disables the breakpoints given as a space separated list of breakpoint numbers. Disabling a breakpoint means it cannot cause the program to stop execution, but unlike clearing a breakpoint, it remains in the list of breakpoints and can be (re-)enabled.

### enable [bpnumber [bpnumber …]]
Enables the breakpoints specified.

### ignore bpnumber [count]
Sets the ignore count for the given breakpoint number. If count is omitted, the ignore count is set to 0. A breakpoint becomes active when the ignore count is zero. When non-zero, the count is decremented each time the breakpoint is reached and the breakpoint is not disabled and any associated condition evaluates to true.

### condition bpnumber [condition]
Condition is an expression which must evaluate to true before the breakpoint is honored. If condition is absent, any existing condition is removed; i.e., the breakpoint is made unconditional.

### commands [bpnumber]
Specify a list of commands for breakpoint number bpnumber. The commands themselves appear on the following lines. Type a line containing just ‘end’ to terminate the commands. An example:

```
(Pdb) commands 1
(com) print some_variable
(com) end
(Pdb)
```

To remove all commands from a breakpoint, type commands and follow it immediately with end; that is, give no commands.

With no bpnumber argument, commands refers to the last breakpoint set.

You can use breakpoint commands to start your program up again. Simply use the continue command, or step, or any other command that resumes execution.

Specifying any command resuming execution (currently continue, step, next, return, jump, quit and their abbreviations) terminates the command list (as if that command was immediately followed by end). This is because any time you resume execution (even with a simple next or step), you may encounter another breakpoint—which could have its own command list, leading to ambiguities about which list to execute.

If you use the ‘silent’ command in the command list, the usual message about stopping at a breakpoint is not printed. This may be desirable for breakpoints that are to print a specific message and then continue. If none of the other commands print anything, you see no sign that the breakpoint was reached.

### s(tep)
Execute the current line, stop at the first possible occasion (either in a function that is called or on the next line in the current function).

### n(ext)
Continue execution until the next line in the current function is reached or it returns. (The difference between next and step is that step stops inside a called function, while next executes called functions at (nearly) full speed, only stopping at the next line in the current function.)

### unt(il)
Continue execution until the line with the line number greater than the current one is reached or when returning from current frame.

### r(eturn)
Continue execution until the current function returns.

### c(ont(inue))
Continue execution, only stop when a breakpoint is encountered.

### j(ump) lineno
Set the next line that will be executed. Only available in the bottom-most frame. This lets you jump back and execute code again, or jump forward to skip code that you don’t want to run.

It should be noted that not all jumps are allowed — for instance it is not possible to jump into the middle of a for loop or out of a finally clause.

### l(ist) [first[, last]]
List source code for the current file. Without arguments, list 11 lines around the current line or continue the previous listing. With one argument, list 11 lines around at that line. With two arguments, list the given range; if the second argument is less than the first, it is interpreted as a count.

### a(rgs)
Print the argument list of the current function.

### p expression
Evaluate the expression in the current context and print its value.

>注解 print can also be used, but is not a debugger command — this executes the Python print statement.

### pp expression
Like the p command, except the value of the expression is pretty-printed using the pprint module.

### alias [name [command]]
Creates an alias called name that executes command. The command must not be enclosed in quotes. Replaceable parameters can be indicated by %1, %2, and so on, while %* is replaced by all the parameters. If no command is given, the current alias for name is shown. If no arguments are given, all aliases are listed.

Aliases may be nested and can contain anything that can be legally typed at the pdb prompt. Note that internal pdb commands can be overridden by aliases. Such a command is then hidden until the alias is removed. Aliasing is recursively applied to the first word of the command line; all other words in the line are left alone.

As an example, here are two useful aliases (especially when placed in the .pdbrc file):

```
#Print instance variables (usage "pi classInst")
alias pi for k in %1.__dict__.keys(): print "%1.",k,"=",%1.__dict__[k]
#Print instance variables in self
alias ps pi self
```

### unalias name
Deletes the specified alias.

### [!]statement
Execute the (one-line) statement in the context of the current stack frame. The exclamation point can be omitted unless the first word of the statement resembles a debugger command. To set a global variable, you can prefix the assignment command with a global command on the same line, e.g.:

```
(Pdb) global list_options; list_options = ['-l']
(Pdb)
```

### run [args …]
Restart the debugged Python program. If an argument is supplied, it is split with “shlex” and the result is used as the new sys.argv. History, breakpoints, actions and debugger options are preserved. “restart” is an alias for “run”.

### q(uit)
Quit from the debugger. The program being executed is aborted.
